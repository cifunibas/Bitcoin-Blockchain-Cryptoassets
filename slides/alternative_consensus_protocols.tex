		Distributed ledger as \color{focus} chain of transactions and states \color{black} whose \color{focus} compliance with an explicit rule set \color{black} is  attested by a reliable network of record keeping nodes.

		\textbf{Explicit and unambiguous rule set} for legitimate changes to the ledger and block sequence.
		\vspace{0.25 em}
		
		$\Rightarrow$ Invalid blocks are detected easily and unambiguously.
		\vspace{1.5 em}
		
		\textbf{Decision mechanism} for consensus over different, legitimate extensions of the ledger. 
		\vspace{0.25 em}
		
		$\Rightarrow$ Swiftly resolving situations of uncertainty.
		\vspace{1.5 em}
		
		\textbf{Incentive system} that rewards compliant behaviour and / or penalizes manipulation attempts.

		$\Rightarrow$ Typically in native protocol asset, tying the participant's interest to the sustainable value of the network.

	\begin{frame}{What Makes a Good Consensus Mechanism?}
		
		Suitability of a consensus mechanism \color{focus} depends on the purpose and user base \color {black} of a decentralized ledger.

	\begin{frame}{Popular Consensus Mechanisms}
		We will look at and compare the following consensus mechanisms:

		\begin{description}[labelwidth=10em]
			\item[\textbf{Scalability}] Every node needs to process every transaction. Block creation is very resource intensive.
			\item[\textbf{Decentralization}] Open network with many participants. Mining pools compromise decentralization.
			\item[\textbf{Security}] Secured by ressource allocation. Simplicity increases security.

	\begin{frame}{Proof of Stake}
		To participate in the consensus network, each node - called a validator - needs to deposit and lock protocol base assets. This is called staking.
		
		\vspace{1.5 em}
		\textbf{Block creation and transaction validation:}
		Block creators are selected at random in proportion to their stake. A set of other validators will then attest to the validity of the created blocks.
		
		\vspace{1.5 em}
		\textbf{Malicious and unresponsive validators:}
		Malicious behaviour is punished by slashing (destroying a significant part) of the staked assets of the offenders. Failure to participate forfeits any rewards and might be punished furhter.
		
		\vspace{1.5 em}
		\textbf{Incentive system:}
		Validators receive returns on their stake by performing their duties. These rewards are funded by transaction costs and/or newly generated assets (inflation).

		\begin{description}[labelwidth=10em]
			\item[\textbf{Scalability}] Only a set of validators need to process each transaction. Proposers are randomly selected.
			\item[\textbf{Decentralization}] Open network with many participants. Potential crowding out over time.
			\item[\textbf{Security}] Secured by staked capital. High complexity of the mechanism reduces security.

	\begin{frame}{Proof of Authority}
		The consensus network consists of a \color{focus}small set of approved nodes\color{black} - called validators. These are often identified and have a reputation attached.
		
		\vspace{1.5 em}
		\textbf{Block creation and transaction validation:}
		Validators create and validate blocks. Other validators will attest to the validity of the created blocks.
		
		\vspace{1.5 em}
		\textbf{Malicious and unresponsive validators:}
		Malicious or unsresponsive behaviour is punished by excluding a validator and negatively impacting their reputation.
		
		\vspace{1.5 em}
		\textbf{Incentive system:}
		Block rewards are usually only the transaction costs.

		\begin{description}[labelwidth=10em]
			\item[\textbf{Scalability}] Very small set of validators and simple mechanism.
			\item[\textbf{Decentralization}] Closed network, validators can easily collude. Almost fully centralized.
			\item[\textbf{Security}] Simple mechanism and only approved validators provide a high security.

		\textbf{Conclusion:} All mechanisms have tradeoffs and might be suited for different use cases.
