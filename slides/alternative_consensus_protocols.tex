		Blockchain as \color{focus} chain of transactions and states \color{black} whose \color{focus} compliance with an explicit rule set \color{black} is  attested by a reliable network of record keeping nodes.

		\textbf{Explicit and unambiguous rule set} for legitimate changes to the ledger and block sequence.

		$\Rightarrow$ Invalid blocks are detected easily and unambiguously.

		\textbf{Decision mechanism} for consensus over different, legitimate extensions of the ledger.

		$\Rightarrow$ Swiftly resolving situations of uncertainty.

		\textbf{Incentive system} that rewards compliant behaviour and / or penalizes manipulation attempts.

		Suitability of a consensus mechanism \color{focus} depends on the purpose and user base \color {black} of a blockchain.

		\begin{description}[labelwidth=10em]
			\item[\textbf{Scalability}] Every full node needs to process every transaction. Block creation is very resource intensive.
			\item[\textbf{Decentralization}] Open network with many participants. Mining pools compromise decentralization.
			\item[\textbf{Security}] Secured by ressource allocation. Simplicity increases security.

	\begin{frame}{Proof of Stake}
		\small
		To participate in the consensus network, each node - called a validator - needs to \color{focus} deposit and lock native protocol assets\color{black}. This is called staking.

	\begin{frame}{Proof of Authority}
		\small
		The consensus network consists of a \color{focus}small set of approved nodes \color{black} - called validators. These are often identified and have a reputation attached.

			\textbf{Malicious and unresponsive validators} \\
			Malicious or unresponsive behavior is punished by excluding a validator and impacting their reputation. Additionally, legal actions are often possible.

	\begin{frame}{Key Takeaways}
		The implementation of a consensus mechanism is highly specific to the project. Parameters and functionality can differ greatly even for the same type of mechanism. \\
		
		\pause
		\vspace{1.5em}
		There exist more consensus mechanisms and research on new mechanisms is ongoing. The consensus mechanism is a key differentiating feature of any blockchain project.
		
		\pause
		\vspace{1.5em}
		It is possible for a blockchain to change its consensus mechanism via a hard fork.
